# Compute Canada

In here you'll find some helpful notes on getting acclimated to scheduling and
running experiments on Compute Canada.

In this doc, I'm going to assume you're some form of CS/CS related student
who's already decently familiar with the UNIX shell and some UNIX utilities.
I'll try to cover some of the basics here, but if you're still confused/want
a deeper understanding of some software, I highly recommend looking up the docs
yourself.
